		<h1>Going to the Beach</h1>
		<details>
			<summary>Where & Why I Love the Beach</summary>
		<p>I love going to the beach with my family. When we go to the beach everyone seems so relaxed.
		We like to look for sea shells, play bocce, and play in the water. I love to eat seafood, and 
		there are many great restaurants near the beach. We go to Tybee Beach a lot because my husband's
		family is from Savannah.</p>

		<h1>National Parks</h1>
		<details>
			<summary>I Want to Visit Every National Park in the US</summary>
		<p>I want to visit every National Park in the US. I love to look at pictures of our
		national parks and I bet the parks are just as beautiful in person. I would either 
		like to take a roadtrip or travel by train. I may have to do this when I retire, I
		just hope I can do it before I die.</p>

	<h1>My Favorite Apps</h1>
	<details>
	<summary>The Apps I Like During My Down Time</summary>
	<p>When I am taking a break from school or house work, I like to look at my phone and play
	on my favorite apps. These apps include, but are not limited to, Amazon, Candy Crush, and Pinterest.
	I love to do my online shopping on Amazon. I make lots of wish list for myself and my family members.
	This helps me keep track of things I would like to buy for myself and gifts for my family. When I play
	Candy Crush, I can feel my OCD kicking in. I feel an urgent need to win and make it to the next level.
	Some people say that playing games makes them more relaxed, but I'm just the opposite. It gets me hyped
	up to the point I can't sleep. This is why I don't play Candy Crush before I go to bed. I also love to
	look at Pinterest. I have so many great ideas "pinned" on Pinterest. Some of my boards are personal ideas,
	such as favorite recipes, gardening, and places I'd like to visit. Other boards deal with teaching, such
	as FBLA ideas, Classroom Ideas, Computer Science, and New Technology. If I could accomplish 1/8 of what I
	have marked on Pinterest, I will have accomplished a lot.</p>
